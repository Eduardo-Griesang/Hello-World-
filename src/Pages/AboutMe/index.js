            I'm 21 years old and I was borned and raised in Rio Grande do Sul
            Brasil. When I was 10 years old my parents got me my first computer,
            back then I used it for playing games and making schoold projects,
            with my first PC I got a passion for tecnologies, and that lead me to
            a carrer as a software developer.{" "}

            Ever since I started my journey coding, I had a special conection with
            Front-End, because it isn't only about the code, it's about making the
            user feel something looking at your page. Front-end development for me
            it's a form of art and expression.{" "}
